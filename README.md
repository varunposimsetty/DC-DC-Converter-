# DC-DC-Converter
DC to DC Converter (Switched Mode Power Supply) Design using SPICE Simulation


In circuit design we need to convert one voltage level to another. We could use the Linear Regulator but they dissipate a lot of heat hence making it very less efficient for large power conversions.


We prefer using the Swithced Mode Power Supply. We could design it as isolated and non-isolated circuit [seperation of input and output electrically].


Non- Isolated DC - DC converter has a simpler design, higher efficiency, and low cost. 


Isolated DC - DC converter has improved noise isolation, imporved complexity and higher cost.


We are currently designing Non - isolated DC - DC Converter ( input and output share a common ground and current can flow directly between them ).


Our design will include desining and simulation of two of such DC-DC Converters namely 


a) Buck Converter Design 


b) Boost Converter Design.


Buck Converter Design: Convertes a higher voltage to a lower voltage.


Boost Converter Design: Convertes a lower volatage to a higher voltage.


There are other designs such as Buck Boost Converter Design and Inverting Converter Design in non - isolated and Flyback converter design, current mode DC DC converter operation for isolated design.
